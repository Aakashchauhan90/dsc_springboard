# Data Science Career Track

## Introduction

This repository contains all the projects that were completed as part of Springboard's Data Science Career Track. However, it does not include the capstone and visualisation projects. They are available as separate repositories at [airbnb](https://github.com/rounakbanik/airbnb), [ted](https://github.com/rounakbanik/ted) and [movies](https://github.com/rounakbanik/movies)
